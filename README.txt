STEPS TO RUN THE CODES

THERE ARE 4 CODE FILES.
THE PROCESS TO RUN THE EACH CODE IS SIMILAR.

* FOR DATASET PART USE THE FOLLOWING LINK  - 
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DG4HkYp6GRQ0T5fWU33waQs1mI-Xpmtb?usp=sharing

    YOU NEED TO UPLOAD THIS DATASET FOLDER IN YOUR GOOGLE DRIVE, IN My Drive FOLDER WITH SAME NAME AS IT IS. (THIS HAS TO BE DONE ONLY ONCE)

* THAN YOU NEED TO OPEN THAT CODE IN GOOGLE COLAB.

* THAT’S IT, WHEN YOU WILL RUN THE CODE, AT INITIAL STEP IT WILL ASK FOR PERMISSION TO ACCESS THE GOOGLE DRIVE, ACCEPT IT AND CONTINUE, RUN EACH CELL TO GET THE OUTPUT.

THESE STEPS ARE COMMON FOR ALL THE 4 ipynb FILES WHICH WILL BE SHARED.
